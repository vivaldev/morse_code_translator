# morse_code_translator

This is a coding exercise I've created to better understand Typescript in React enviroment and the logic in general. It is only the first project I've done and finished using ChatGPT-4 with my "senior dev", it giving me good enquidament whole through the process. This was not done to train how to work with AI-assistance, but more of mentoring experience.

Clone the repo:
gh repo clone vivaldev/morse_code_translator 

Run:
npm run dev
