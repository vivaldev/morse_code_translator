# Morse Code Translator

## Description

This is a simple Morse Code Translator app I did as an exercise. You can practice your Morse Code skills by getting familiar with it alphabet and numbers. It's created using ChatGPT-4 as my guidance in a role of mentoring "senior dev", so it's not an exercise of how to develop using AI - as I've said, this has been a learning experience for me, so all the solutions and everything are created by me.

The app includes instructions, which are shown on the first page. All the rules are following international Morse Code standards.
